  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (also known as WWW, W3, or simply the Web[1]) is an information system that enables content
    sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and
    hobbyists.[2] It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific
    rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and
    other objects, such as
    interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
